{"bulletins":[{"avalancheActivity":{"comment":"Caution: marked weak layers in old snow: activities in backcountry demand cautious evaluation of the terrain and the dangers, as well as restraint. Avalanches which release can fracture to deeper layers in the old snowpack and grow to medium size. Such danger zones occur especially on steep shady slopes and are impossible to spot. Also remote triggerings are possible. Whumpf noises and fractures when treading on the surface are alarm signals. On sunny slopes, generally small loose-snow avalanches can trigger naturally during the course of the day. In addition, trigger-sensitive snowdrift accumulations will be generated during the day in foehn-exposed regions.","highlights":"Caution: marked weak layers in old snow"},"avalancheProblems":[{"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"problemType":"persistent_weak_layers","aspects":["N","NE","E","W","NW"],"elevation":{"lowerBound":"2200"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"},{"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"problemType":"persistent_weak_layers","aspects":["N","NE","E","W","NW"],"elevation":{"upperBound":"2200"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"}],"bulletinID":"21277739-b686-4376-add3-dbefe76a3c19","customData":{"ALBINA":{"mainDate":"2026-02-02"},"LWD_Tyrol":{"dangerPatterns":[]}},"dangerRatings":[{"mainValue":"moderate","elevation":{"upperBound":"2200"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"},{"mainValue":"considerable","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2200"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"}],"lang":"en","publicationTime":"2026-02-02T05:50:55+00:00","regions":[{"regionID":"AT-08-05-01","name":"Rätikon East"},{"regionID":"AT-08-05-02","name":"Rätikon West"},{"regionID":"AT-08-06","name":"Silvretta West"},{"regionID":"AT-08-03-02","name":"Lechquellen Mountains"},{"regionID":"AT-08-03-01","name":"Lechtal Alps Vorarlberg"},{"regionID":"AT-08-04","name":"Verwall West"}],"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"Older snowdrift accumulations from last week often lie deposited atop loose old snow at high altitudes, and a weak old snowpack, particularly on steep shady slopes.
