{"bulletins":[{"avalancheActivity":{"comment":"The avalanche risk is moderate above 2000 metres and low below. The main problem is wind slab. Slab avalanches can be triggered sporadically with little additional load. Avalanche prone locations are adjacent to ridgelines and distant from ridgelines in steep terrain with aspects from northwest to north to east as well as at the entrance to gullies and bowls. They increase in number and size with altitude. Avalanches can become medium-sized - when they tear through deeper weak layers in the persistent weak layer.","highlights":"Take care when entering gullies and bowls!"},"avalancheProblems":[{"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"problemType":"wind_slab","aspects":["E","NW","N","NE"],"elevation":{"lowerBound":"2000"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"},{"customData":{"ALBINA":{"avalancheType":"slab"}},"problemType":"persistent_weak_layers","aspects":["E","NW","N","NE"],"elevation":{"lowerBound":"1600"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"}],"bulletinID":"92546778-78dc-4d5d-811a-8eaa46c5f2cf","customData":{"ALBINA":{"mainDate":"2026-02-05"},"LWD_Tyrol":{"dangerPatterns":[]}},"dangerRatings":[{"mainValue":"low","elevation":{"upperBound":"2000"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"},{"mainValue":"moderate","elevation":{"lowerBound":"2000"},"validTimePeriod":"all_day"}],"lang":"en","publicationTime":"2026-02-04T16:00:00+00:00","regions":[{"regionID":"DE-BY-30","name":"Werdenfels Alps"},{"regionID":"DE-BY-60","name":"Berchtesgaden Alps"},{"regionID":"DE-BY-12","name":"Allgäu  Alps Central"}],"snowpackStructure":{"comment":"With mild temperatures, the snowpack is increasingly settling.
