# Forecast Archive Context

## Overview
This directory (`forecast-archive/`) serves as a **navigation hub** for accessing regional avalanche bulletin archives.

## Purpose
- **Central Entry Point**: Provides a single landing page linking to all regional bulletin archives.
- **User Navigation**: Simplifies access to historical bulletins organized by region.

## Structure
- **`index.html`**: Static navigation page with links to:
  - Allgäu Prealps (Sonthofen)
  - Allgäu Alps Central (Oberstdorf)
  - Allgäu Alps West (Kleinwalsertal)
  - Allgäu Alps East (Tannheimer Tal)

## Integration
- Referenced by `buildPdfArchive.js` as a back-link from regional archive pages.
- Linked from the main site navigation.

## Important Notes
- **Auto-Generated**: This page is now dynamically generated by `buildPdfArchive.js` to ensure consistency with `REGION_CONFIG`.
- **Naming**: The name "forecast-archive" is slightly misleading - it's actually a navigation page to bulletin archives, not forecasts.
- **Regeneration**: Runs automatically during `npm run build`.
