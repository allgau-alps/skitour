# Archive Directory Context

## Overview
This directory (`archive/`) contains the **static output** of the avalanche archiver.
The contents here are generated by the build scripts in `tools/` and are intended to be served as a static website.

## Directory Structure
- **Regions** (`allgau-alps-*`, `allgau-prealps`): Daily avalanche bulletin archives (PDFs converted to HTML indices).
- **`incidents/`**: Database of avalanche incidents with detailed reports and images.
- **`profiles/`**: Snow profiles (digs) fetched from regional services.
- **`weather/`**: Daily mountain weather reports.
- **`snow-depth/`**: Interactive map showing snow depth.
- **`ground-conditions/`**: User-uploaded observations.
- **`webcams/`**: Collection of webcam snapshots.

## Data Flow
1. **Scraping**: Scripts in `tools/` fetch data daily and save raw JSON/PDFs to `data/`.
2. **Building**: `tools/build.js` orchestrates various builders (in `tools/lib/builders/`) to generate the HTML pages in this `archive/` directory.
3. **Serving**: The static HTML files here are served to the user.

## Modification Warning
> [!WARNING]
> Do not manually edit HTML files in this directory. 
> They are overwritten every time `npm run build` is executed.
> To change content, edit the source data in `data/` or the builder logic in `tools/lib/builders/`.
